Final draft of UML can be found in the testing tag because I changed 
things in testing.

I also made changes to phase 1 while in phase 2 because I needed to plan 
more functions than I thought of originally.

USAGE:

```
$ python src/main.py FRACTAL_NAME [Color]

*Color is optional*
```

`FRACTAL_NAME` is the name of a fractal image this program is capable of
producing.  When you run one of the programs without this argument, it will
list names of images it can draw and quits.  The same happens when an
unrecognized `FRACTAL_NAME` is given.
