# CS 1440 Assignment 5.0: Refactoring - Code Smells Report

## Instructions

Edit this file and include it in your submission.

For each code smell found in the starter code:

*	Note where you found it (filename + relative information to locate the smell)
    *   You do not need to list code smells in any particular order
*	Describe the smell and why it is a problem
*	Paste up to 10 lines of offensive code between a triple-backtick fence `` ``` ``
    *   If the block of bad code is longer than 10 lines, paste a brief, representative snippet
*	Describe how you can fix it
    *   We will follow up on these notes to make sure it was really fixed!
*   At least *one instance* of each smell is required for full marks
    *   Reporting one smell multiple times does not make up for not reporting another smell
    *   Ex: reporting two global variables does not make it okay to leave spaghetti code blank



## 10 Code Smells

If you find a code smell that is not on this list, please add it to your report.

0.  **Magic** numbers
    *   These are literal values used in critical places without any context or meaning
    *   "Does the `256` right here have anything to do with the `256` over there?"
1.  **Global** variables
    *   Used to avoid passing a parameter into a function
    *   Used to return an extra value from a function
    *   There are better ways to meet both of these needs!
    *   *Note, this does not apply to global `CONSTANTS`!*
2.  **Poorly-named** identifiers
    *   Variable names should strike a good balance between brevity and descriptiveness
    *   Short variable names are okay in some situations:
        *   `i` or `j` as a counter in a brief `for` loop
        *   Variables from well-known math formulae should match the textbook (i.e. `a`, `b` and `c` are familiar in a quadratic or Pythagorean formula)
        *   Otherwise, short names should be avoided
    *   Variables with really, really long names make code harder to read
    *   Variables that override or "shadow" other identifiers
        *   Builtin Python functions such as `input`, `len`, `list`, `max`, `min` and `sum` are especially susceptible to this
3.  **Bad** Comments
    *   Comments are condiments for code; a small amount can enhance a meal, but too much ruins it
    *   Strive to write clear, self-documenting code that speaks for itself; when a line needs an explanatory comment to be understood, it indicates that identifier names were poorly chosen
    *   Delete obsolete remarks that no longer accurately describe the situation
    *   The same goes for blocks of commented-out code that serve no purpose and clutter up the file
    *   Programmers sometimes vent their frustration with snarky or vulgar comments; these add no value, are unprofessional and embarrassing, and only serve to demoralize maintainers
4.  **Too many** arguments
    *   Seen when more than a handful of parameters are passed to a function/method
    *   Parameters that are passed in but never used
5.  Function/Method that is **too long**
    *   Too many lines of code typically happens because the function/method has too many different responsibilities
    *   Generally, a method longer than a dozen lines should make you ask yourself these questions
        *   "Does one function really need to do all of this work?"
        *   "Could I split this into smaller, more focused pieces?"
6.  **Redundant** code
    *   A repeated statement which doesn't have an effect the second time
    *   Ask yourself whether it makes any difference to be run more than once
    *   ```python
        i = 7
        print(i)
        i = 7
        ```
7.  Decision tree that is **too complex**
    *   Too long or deeply nested trees of `if/elif/else`
    *   Are all of the branches truly necessary?
    *   Can all branches even be reached?
    *   Has every branch been tested?
8.  **Spaghetti** code
    *   Heaps of meandering code without a clear goal
    *   Functions/objects used in inconsistent ways
    *   Many variables are used to keep track of
    *   Conditional statements with long, confusing Boolean expressions
    *   Boolean expressions expressing double negatives; ex. `if not undone: ...`
    *   Code that makes you say "It would be easier to rewrite this than to understand it"
9.  **Dead** code
    *   Modules that are imported but not used
    *   Variables that are declared but not used
    *   Lines that are *never* run because they are placed in an impossible-to-reach location
        *   Code that appears after a `return` statement
            *   ```python
                return value
                value += 1
                ```
        *   Blocks of code guarded by an impossible-to-satisfy logical test
            *   ```python
                two_bee = True
                if two_bee and not two_bee:
                    print("If can you see this message, it is time to get a new CPU")
                ```
            *   ```python
                counter = 100
                while counter < 0:
                    print(f"T minus {counter}...")
                    counter -= 1
                ```
    *   Functions that are defined but never called *may* or *may not* be dead code
        *   In **Code Libraries** it is normal to define functions that are not meant to be used in the library itself
            *   It is okay to keep these functions
        *   As an **Application** evolves, calls to some of its functions may be removed until only the function's definition remains
            *   Some programmers may keep these functions "just in case" they are needed again
            *   We don't do this at DuckieCorp because we have Git; if we ever need to recover that function, we can find it in the repo's history


### Template

0.  Smell at `file` [lines xx-yy or general location]
    *   [Brief description of smell]
    *   [Code Snippet between triple-backquotes `` ``` ``]
    *   [How to resolve]


### Example

0.  Redundant Code at `src/main.py` [lines 28, 30]
    *   The import statement `import mbrot_fractal` occurs twice.  A second occurrence doesn't do it better than the first
    *   ```python
        import mbrot_fractal
        import phoenix_fractal as phoenix
        import mbrot_fractal
        ```
    *   Remove the second `import` statement
